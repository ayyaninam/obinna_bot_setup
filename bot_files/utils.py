        With the tools that we have provided, both of you have all that you need to ensure a successful, and protected promotional collab.\n
        First, create a task-list to guarantee that everything you want out of the collab takes place.\n
        To add, remove or edit tasks, use:
        “/add-task, /remove-task, /edit-task.”\n
        Once you have agreed on tasks, and the influencer wants to signify completion of one, use:
        “/agree-to-list and /complete-task”\n
        Once you have created and agreed upon the list, negotiate the price terms through the chat BEFORE the influencer sends offer “/send-offer” to the artist. After the offer has been paid, funds will be released to the influencer in a successful collaboration and refunded back to the artist if needed. """
